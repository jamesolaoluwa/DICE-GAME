# Dice Rolling Game

This Python script implements a simple dice rolling game between two players. The game consists of 10 rounds, and each round, both players roll two dice. 
The player with the higher total score for that round wins, and if it's a draw, both players get a point. After all rounds, the script determines the overall winner.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository or download the Python script.

2. Run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python rolldice.py
   ```

3. The game will simulate 10 rounds of dice rolling.

4. For each round, the script will display the scores of both players and announce the round winner.

5. At the end of the game, the script will declare the overall winner based on the total points earned by each player.

## Example Output
